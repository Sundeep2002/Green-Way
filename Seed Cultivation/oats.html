            <h1>How To Grow Oats Crop</h1>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Oats or common Oat is an important Cereal crop as well as a fodder crop. The cultivation of Oat is
                similar to the wheat crop. Oat is mainly grown in Temperate and Subtropical climates. It can thrive well
                in high-altitude tropics. They are popular due to their health benefits. Oatmeal is a famous food. Oats
                are rich in proteins and fiber. They help in weight loss, controlling blood pressure, and for building a
                strong immune system. Oats are one of the crops grown during the Rabi season and it is an important
                Cereal crop as well as a fodder crop. Oats offer numerous health benefits such as they are rich in
                protein and fiber, so it helps reduce weight, control blood pressure, and increasing the power of
                fighting diseases.

            <h2>Soil and climate conditions</h2>
            <h3>Climate Condition</h3>
            <p>The cold and dry climate is considered suitable for the cultivation of oats. Temperature of 15 to 25
                degree centigrade is considered best for its cultivation. Rainfall should be 80-100 mm. Sowing
                Temperature should be between 20-25°C.

                Harvesting Temperature should be between 25-30°C</p>
            <h3>Soil Conditions:</h3>
            <p>Oat seeds will germinate at 5°C. Though, like most plants, Oats will germinate faster as soil temps
                increase; the goal is to balance an early planting date with biological limitations and the potential
                for seed predation or pathogen issues. While early planting dates mean higher yield and test weight
                potential, this spring has pushed the limit on what early planting can mean with some farmers planting
                in early to mid-March.

                Planting into a firm seedbed and ensuring proper seed to soil contact will give Oats a good start. A
                firm seedbed should go some ways towards modulation of seeding depth, which, for a small grain-like Oats
                should not exceed 1.5 to 2 inches.</p>



            <h2>Sowing -</h2>
            <p>Sowing plump seed at the right depth is an important step towards achieving vigorous, healthy seedlings.
                Planting must be deep enough to provide uniform coverage of the seed and to help maintain moist
                conditions for germination. The recommended depth for most Oat varieties is 3 to 6cm. Oat seedlings
                emerge by elongation of the mesocotyl and coleoptile (in wheat and barley it is through elongation of
                the coleoptile) so Oats can safely be sown deeper than wheat and barley.</p>

            <h2>Sowing Space-</h2>
            <p>The spacing of 25 to 30 cm should be kept between rows. Spring planted Oats do not produce many tillers.
                Consequently, a higher seeding rate and slightly shallower planting depth result in faster establishment
                and increased growth. Growth is improved when the seed is drill-planted at a seeding rate of 80 to 100
                pounds of seed per acre (25 to 30 seeds/sq. ft.). Seeding depth can be as deep as about 1½ inches, but
                planting at only ½ to ¾ inches deep will increase the rate of emergence, establishment, and forage
                production potential.</p>

            <h2>Fertilizer</h2>
            <p>FYM should be added at the time of land preparation. Apply 30 kg of Nitrogen in form of (Urea 66 kg) and
                8 kg of Phosphorus (in form of SSP@50 kg) per acre. Apply half dose of nitrogen and full dose of
                Phosphorus at the time of sowing. Apply remaining amount of Nitrogen, 30-40 days after sowing.</p>

            <h2>Irrigation </h2>
            <p>Usually Oats are cultivated as a rain-fed crop. However, in the case of the irrigated crops, 2 to 3
                irrigations should be given once a month depending on soil moisture and climate.</p>

            <h2>Diseases occurred in crop:</h2>
            <p>Timely control of pests and diseases in oats crop utmost priority for getting higher yields.</p>
            <p><strong>Pests:</strong>Aphids are the main insect pests that attack the oats crop. Aphids can suck the
                cell sap by damaging the crop. Ultimately aphids can cause leaves mottling and distortion. As part of
                preventive measures, you can spray Dimethoate 30EC @ 0.03%. Avoid this fodder to feed the livestock at
                least for 2 weeks after the spray.</p>
            <p><strong>Diseases:</strong>Root rot and leaf blotch are common diseases found in oats crops. Root rot and
                blotch diseases can be treated by proper seed treatment before sowing the seeds.</p>

            <h2>Oats Harvest snd Yielding Process</h2>
            <h3>Harvesting</h3>
            <p>Well, you can get the crop in hand after 4 to 5 months of sowing depending on the variety cultivated.
                Harvesting oats on time are important as late picking may cause grain shedding.</p>

            <h3>Yielding</h3>
            <p>Yield of oats depends on cultivar( variety), season, crop type (rain-fed or irrigated), soil type, and
                crop management practices.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If the crop is grown for grain, 15 to 20 quintal grain and 25 to 30 quintals of straw/ha can be
                    obtained under ideal crop management practices.</li>
                <li>If the crop is grown for fodder, the yield is about 250 to 300 quintals fodder and 4 to 5 quintals
                    of grain/ha can be obtained.</li>

            </ul>
