      <h1>How To Grow Cotton Crop</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Cotton is that the most vital fibre crop not only of India but of the whole world. It provides the fundamental
        material to cotton textile industry. it's one in all the foremost important commercial crops playing a key role
        in economics. In India cotton is cultivated in 9 million hectares in varied agro-climatic conditions across 9
        major States. Cotton cultivation offers 200 ha of employment. Current estimates for world production are about
        110 million bales annually accounting for two.5% of the world's arable land. India has the biggest area under
        cotton, but its production is simply 15.8 million bales, much lower for the vast area.</p>
        <img class="center" src="../img/cotton/cotton.jpg" alt="Cotton" width="350px">

      <h2>Soil and climate conditions</h2>
      <h3>Climatic conditions – </h3>
      <p>Cotton is that the crop of tropical and sub-tropical areas.it requires uniformly hot temperature varying
        between 21°C and 27°C. for the successful increase of its seeds, a minimum temperature of 16o C is required. the
        expansion of cotton is retarded when the temperature falls below 19°C, but it can tolerate temperatures as high
        as 43 o C. During October, the day temperature should be above 26 which helps the ripening and bursting of
        cotton balls under the sunny skies.</p>
      <h3>Soil conditions – </h3>
      <p>In cotton selection on of soil is extremely important. Cotton is grown on a spread of soils. Cotton grows best
        in soil with a pH between 5.8 to 8.0. Cotton cultivation is closely associated with deep black soils (regur) of
        the Deccan and therefore the Malwa Plateaus and people of Gujarat. Soil should be black medium to deep (90cm)
        having good drainage availability. It also grows well in alluvial soils of the Satluj-Ganga Plain and red and
        laterite soils of the peninsular regions. Irrigated cotton is taken within the alluvial soils. Cotton quickly
        exhausts the fertility of soil. Cotton doesn't tolerate water-logging condition. it's grown mainly as a dry crop
        within the black cotton and medium black soil.</p>

      <h2>Cultivation –</h2>
      <p>Buying fresh and thoroughly selected cotton seeds is that the beginning towards a decent yield. The second step
        is that the field preparation, in order that it can welcome the seeds and facilitate their germination. Sowing
        of cotton seeds takes place during spring. Fertilization, Irrigation and Pest Control are extremely important
        for having an honest yield and represent the bulk of costs. Unfortunately, cotton plants are very sensitive to
        numerous weeds, which compete with them in terms of water, nutrients and access to sunlight. Cotton weed control
        techniques and management differ significantly between countries. Cotton harvest takes place during autumn.
        Immediately after the harvest, we destroy the plants, in order that we will sow the seeds again next spring in
        an empty field.</p>

      <h3>Species :</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Gossypium hirsutum – cotton (accounts for over 90% of world production, gives normally top quality cotton
          with high strength and elasticity).</li>
        <li>Gossypium herbaceum – Herbaceous cotton (is native to Pakistan, India and to some parts of Africa.)</li>
        <li>Gossypium barbadense – it's cultivated in Egypt, Sudan, USA, Brazil and Peru.</li>
        <li>Gossypium arboreum – Cotton tree (native to Pakistan, country and India). it's not widely cultivated,
          because it normally gives short fibers of poor quality</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Field preparation :</h3>
      <p>Cotton is sown on ridges and furrows. For irrigated cotton the land is given a deep ploughing followed by two
        harrowings. Ridges and furrows having different spacing for irrigated and rainfed cotton. For irrigated cotton
        shallow ridges on 90cm spacing should be prepared which helps in irrigation. consistent with slope of land,
        length of ridges should be 6-9m.</p>
      <h3>Irrigated cotton</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Hybrid variety (medium soil)- 90x90cm</li>
        <li>Deep black soil - 120x90cm</li>
        <li>Other varieties- 90x90cm</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Rainfed cotton</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Indigenous variety - 45x22.5cm</li>
        <li> American variety - 60x30cm </li>
        <li> Hybrid varieties - 60x60cm, 75x75cm, 90x90cm </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Sowing</h2>
      <p>Before sowing soil should be irrigated and after wapsa condition sowing should be done. Small shallow holes
        should be prepared on middle of the ridge upto 2-3 inch deep and applied recommended fertilizers and 1.0-1.5
        gram of thimet and canopy it with the soil. On each hill 3-4 cotton seeds should be dibble and canopy completely
        with the soil and apply irrigation immediately. In North and Central India irrigated crop is sown from March-May
        and rainfed crop in June-July with the commencement of the monsoon. In South India the foremost portion of the
        irrigated and rainfed crop is planted in September-October, whereas the sowing of the rainfed crops extended
        upto November. In Karnataka desi cotton is sometimes sown in August-September.</p>

        <h2>Fertilizer</h2>
      <p>The fertilizer required for irrigated cotton is 100:50:50kg nitrogen, phosphorus and potash per hectare is
        usually recommended. the appliance of nitrogen is given by ring method. 20% nitrogen and whole phosphorus and
        potash should run at the time of sowing and 40% nitrogen at the time of square formation and final 40% nitrogen
        at the time of flowering. rainfed cotton hybrids and 50:25:25 NPK kg/ha both for desi and hirsutum varieties are
        recommended. For hybrid varieties fertilizer dose is 80:40:40 nitrogen, phosphorus and potash per hectare. </p>
      <h2>Irrigation</h2>
      <strong>Germination Phase(1-15 days)</strong>
      <p>Irrigate for germination and establishment</p>
      <strong>No. of Irrigations - 2</strong>
      <strong>Days after dibbling seeds</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Immediately after sowing</li>
        <li>Give a life irrigation on 5th day of sowing to facilitate the seedlings
          to emerge out</li>
      </ul>

      <strong>Vegetative phase (16-44 days)</strong>
      <p>Regulate</p>

      <h3>Plant protection</h3>
      <h3>Pest</h3>
      <h3>Jassids(amrasca biguttula biguttula) and aphids (aphis gossypii)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Both nymphs and adults found on the underside of the leaves, sucking the sap</li>
        <li>Leaves turn pale, red rust, curls downwards and dry up infestation is severe.</li>
        <li>In severe cases the leaves turn chocolate red and crumple</li>
        <li>In such cases, the expansion of plant is additionally stunted.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>To Control</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Sow resistant varieties</li>
        <li>spray the crop fortnightly with 0.02% Phosphamidon, Monocrotophos, Methyl demeton, Dichlorros or Dimethoate,
          starting with the looks of the pest</li>
        <li>2-3 sprayings is also necessary.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>American Bollworm</h3>
      <p>Destructive pest, caterpillar borer into square flowers and boll and feed within the boll. While feeding head
        of caterpillar is inside the square or boll and remaining portion is outside the square and boll.</p>
      <h3>To Control</h3>
      <p>When infestation is seen spray following pyrethroids per hectare in 500 litres of water: -
        Cypermethrin 25%- 200ml or 10%-500ml or Decamethrin 2.8%- 400ml or 20%- 250ml.
      </p>
      <h3>Red cotton bug</h3>
      <p>Nymphs and adults suck the sap from the flowers, buds and bolls and taint the lint with faeces. The infested
        bolls open badly and also the quality of the lint is further affected.</p>
      <h3>Cotton leaf roller</h3>
      <p>Caterpillars roll the cotton leaves and feed within. Exotic varieties are more susceptible. Moths, medium sized
        with yellow wings. active from mid-July to September.</p>
      <h3>To Control</h3>
      <p>Hand-picking and destruction of rolled leaves with larvae within. Spray 0.1% Carbaryl or 0.04% Monocrotophos.
        Repeat, if necessary.</p>

      <h2>Cotton Harvest and Yielding</h2>
      <p>Cotton can either be picked by hand or by machines. Cotton is fully mature and ready for harvesting
        approximately 160 days after being planted. Once the bolls have burst open, the farmers can prepare the cotton
        plants for harvesting. First picking of cotton should be done when 30-35% bolls open fully. Picking should be
        done early within the morning. At the time of picking first pick clean cotton so affected cotton. It should be
        picked separately of various varieties. Second picking should be done 15-20 days after first picking. After
        picking it should be dried 3-4 days in sun with charge. Cotton should be stored at clean and dry place.
        Irrigated cotton. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Improved varieties - 20-24 quintal per hectare</li>
        <li>Hybrid varieties - 25-30 quintal per hectare </li>
