      <h1>How To Grow Wheat Crop</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Wheat is one of the world’s most commonly consumed cereal grains. It comes from a type of grass (Triticum) that
        is grown in countless varieties worldwide. Bread wheat, or common wheat, is the primary species. Several other
        closely related species include durum, spelt, emmer, einkorn, and Khorasan wheat. White and whole-wheat flour
        are key ingredients in baked goods, such as bread. Other wheat-based foods include pasta, noodles, semolina,
        bulgur, and couscous. Wheat is highly controversial because it contains a protein called gluten, which can
        trigger a harmful immune response in predisposed individuals. However, for people who tolerate it, whole-grain
        wheat can be a rich source of various antioxidants, vitamins, minerals, and fiber. This article tells you
        everything you need to know about wheat.
      </p>

      <h2>Soil and climate conditions</h2>
      <h3>Climatic conditions – </h3>
      <p>Weather that is comfortable for humans is also good for wheat. Wheat needs 12 to 15 inches (31 to 38
        centimeters) of water to produce a good crop. It grows best when temperatures are warm, from 70° to 75° F (21°
        to 24° C), but not too hot. Wheat also needs a lot of sunshine, especially when the grains are filling. Areas
        with low humidity are better since many wheat diseases thrive in damp weather.
        Spring wheat and winter wheat differ not only in the time they are planted but also in their temperature
        requirements. Winter wheat, which is planted in the fall, becomes dormant when temperatures drop below freezing.
        It remains alive but does not grow until the weather becomes warmer. Winter wheat actually requires cold weather
        in order to develop normally. If planted in the spring, it will not form heads. In extreme cold, however, winter
        wheat can die. During cold weather, a snow-covered ground insulates the soil and keeps the wheat warmer than the
        air.
        Wheat grows in many types of soil, but it grows best in well-drained loam or clay-loam soils. Two major threats
        to the wheat plant’s growth are poor soil drainage and high levels of soil acidity. The large amount of aluminum
        usually contained in acidic soils is poisonous to wheat. Some of the elements necessary for growth that are
        provided by the soil are nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, sulfur, zinc, copper, boron, manganese, iron, and
        magnesium. Of these, nitrogen is required in the largest amount because it is part of all the proteins in the
        plant. Wheat also needs a lot of phosphorus, most of which ends up in the grain. Other nutrients from the soil
        are needed in smaller amounts, but all must be present for healthy plant growth and color.
      </p>
      <h3>Soil conditions – </h3>
      <p>Soil Wheat is grown in a variety of soils of India. Soils with a clay loam or loam texture, good structure and
        moderate water holding capacity are ideal for wheat cultivation. Care should be taken to avoid very porous and
        excessively drained oils. Soil should be neutral in its reaction. Heavy soil with good drainage are suitable for
        wheat cultivation under dry conditions. These soils absorb and retain rain water well. Heavy soils with poor
        structure and poor drainage are not suitable as wheat is sensitive to water logging. Wheat can be successfully
        grown on lighter soils provided their water and nutrient holding capacity are improved</p>
      <p>The time and placement of fertilizer is another area where significant progress was made. It was demonstrated
        that 120 kg nitrogen, 60 kg phosphorus and 30 kg potash per hectare were required for optimum prto be applied in
        two split doses of 60 kg as basal and the remaining 60 kg at first irrigation and full phosphorus and potash to
        be applied as basal. Recently, the new wheat varieties have responded up to 180 kg N/ha with optima dose around
        150 kg/ha. In the Indo-Gangetic plains, application of zinc @ 25kg/ha in rice-wheat system was found to increase
        the yield substantially. Recently, the use of sulphur has been found beneficial for enhancing the productivity
        as well as the grain protein content of wheat. Response to Mn (pockets in the Indo-Gangetic plains) and boron
        (eastern and far eastern region) has also been With intensive agriculture, deficiency of essential nutrients has
        also become wide spread. The work conducted under the All India Coordinated Research Project on Micronutrient in
        Crops and Soils, has shown wide spread deficiency of zinc in soils in India. At the national level, the
        deficiency level in micro nutrients is Zn: 46 %, B: 17 %, Mo: 12 %, Fe: 11 % and Cu: 5%. The deficiency of
        sulphur has also been reported across a wide range of soils (38%).The yield response to sulphur has been
        obtained in more than 40 crops including cereal, millets, oilseeds and pulses etc. To realize the potential
        yield, strategies may include.</p>

      <h2>Cultivation –</h2>
      <p>The wheat crop requires a well-pulverized but compact seed bed for good and uniform germination. Three or four
        ploughings in the summer, repeated harrowing in the rainy season, followed by three or four cultivations and
        planking immediately before sowing produce a good, firm seed bed for the dry crop on alluvial soils.</p>

      <h3>Species :</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Common Wheat or Bread wheat - (T. aestivum) A hexaploid species that is the most widely cultivated in the
          world.</li>
        <li>Durum - (T. durum) The only tetraploid form of wheat widely used today, and the second most widely
          cultivated wheat today.</li>
        <li>Einkorn - (T. monococcum) A diploid species with wild and cultivated variants. One of the earliest
          cultivated, but rarely planted today.</li>
        <li>Emmer - (T. dicoccon) A tetraploid species, cultivated in ancient times but no longer in widespread use.
        </li>
        <li>Spelt - (T. spelta) Another hexaploid species cultivated in limited quantities.</li>
        <li>Kamut® or QK-77 - (T. polonicum or T. durum) A trademarked tetraploid cultivar grown in small quantities
          that is extensively marketed. Originally from the Middle East.</li>
        <li>Kaploid - (T. Kapioto) This is a type of wheat that is grown only in the tropical regions of Australia. Some
          people call it the shitty wheat. Because of this unfortunate name, it has been removed from some supermarkets
          around the country.</li>
        <li>Stephens - A soft white variety that has been a popular choice for many year in the inland Pacific Northwest
          due to its high yield potential and winter hardiness</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Field preparation :</h3>
      <p>Fields are usually prepared by giving one deep ploughing followed by two to three ploughing with local plough
        and then planking. In these areas, ploughing should be done in the evening and furrows should be kept open whole
        night to absorb dew moisture. Planking should be done early in the morning</h3>

      <h3>Irrigated Wheat</h3>
      <p>Producing Irrigated Winter Wheat (EC731) Provides production guidelines specific to growing irrigated winter
        wheat, from preparing the seedbed through harvest of the crop. ... Weekly water use from planting to harvest for
        irrigated winter wheat.</p>
        <img class="center" src="../img/wheat/wheat  crop image 3.jpg" alt="Wheat" width="350px">
      <h3>Rainfed cotton</h3>
      <p>Wheat is the second most important crop after rice and is widely cultivated in India mainly under irrigated
        condition; however a large area is covered under rainfed wheat where crop is produced without supplemental
        irrigation. Rainfed agriculture is a type of farming that relies on rainfall for water. ... Rainfed agriculture
        is distinguished in most of the literature from irrigated agriculture, which applies water from other sources,
        such as freshwater from streams, rivers and lakes or groundwater.</p>
      <h2>Sowing</h2>
      <strong>Time of Sowing:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Wheat must be sown at the optimum time. Delayed sowing causes a gradual decline in the yield of wheat. The
          time of sowing is 25 October – November.</li>
        <li>For normal sown crop a spacing of 20 - 22.5 cm between rows is recommended. When sowing is delayed a closer
          spacing of 15-18 cm should be adopted</li>
      </ul>
      <strong>Sowing Depth</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>The sowing depth should be 4-5 cm.</li>
      </ul>
      <strong>Method of Sowing</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>Seed drill</li>
        <li>Broadcasting method</li>
        <li>Zero tillage drill</li>
        <li>Rotavator</li>
      </ul>
      <img class="center" src="../img/wheat/wheat  crop image 4.jpg" alt="Wheat" width="350px">
      <h2>Fertilizer</h2>
      <p>A balanced combination of Pro-Germinator and N-Suite products supply vital macronutrients (mainly phosphorus
        and nitrogen), as well as micro- and secondary nutrients, like sulfur. These products are also designed to
        release slowly, so they are available when and where the crop needs them. </p>
      <p>Winter wheat fertilized with AgroLiquid products not only provides higher yields, but it also reduces several
        risks. By accessing additional nutrients, wheat crops are more resistant to pests, disease, fungus, drought, and
        stress.</p>
      <h2>Irrigation</h2>
      <strong>Forming Beds and Channel</strong>
      <p>Form beds of size 10 m2 or 20 m2. The irrigation channels are to be provided sufficiently. </p>
      <strong>Water Management</strong>
      <p>The crop requires 4 - 6 irrigations depending on the soil type and rainfall.
        Wheat crop requires minimum of 5 irrigations at the following critical stages.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Immediate after sowing</li>
        <li>Crown root intiation : 15-20 Days</li>
        <li>Active tillering stage : 35-40 Days</li>
        <li>Flowering stage : 50-55 Days</li>
        <li>Grain filling stage : 70-75 Days</li>

      </ul>

      <h2>Wheat Harvest and Yielding</h2>
      <p>Wheat (Triticum spp.) occupies the prime position among the food crops in the world. In India, it is the second
        important food crop being next to rice and contributes to the total foodgrain production of the country to the
        extent of about 25%. Wheat has played a very vital role in stabilizing the foodgrain production in the country
        over the past few years.</p>
      <p>The origin of the durum wheats was probably in the region of Abyssinia, whereas the whole group of soft wheat,
        which includes the bread wheats, probably originated in the region of Pakistan, SouthWestern and the Southern
        parts of mountainous Bokhara.</p>
