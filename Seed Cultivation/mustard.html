            <h1>How To Grow Mustard Crop</h1>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Mustard is a member of the “Cruciferae” family and is commonly used in Indian cooking. India is the
                world's fourth largest producer of oilseeds, with rapeseed and mustard accounting for approximately 28.6
                percent of total oilseed production. It is the world's third most important oilseed after soybeans and
                palm oil. In India, mustard seed is used as a condiment in the preparation of vegetables and curries.
            </p>

            <h2>Soil and climate conditions</h2>
            <h3>Climate Condition</h3>
            <p>Subtropical climates are ideal for growing mustard. Mustard thrives in dry and cool climates, so it is
                typically grown as a Rabi season crop. Mustard crops require temperatures ranging from 10°C to 25°C.
                Mustard crops are grown in areas with annual rainfall ranging from 625 to 1000 mm. Because this crop
                cannot tolerate frost, it requires a clear sky and frost-free conditions. </p>
            <h3>Soil Conditions:</h3>
            <p>Mustard can be grown in a wide range of soil types, from light to heavy soil.Mustard cultivation is best
                suited to medium to deep soils with good drainage. Mustard grows best in soil with a pH range of 6.0 to
                7.5. Make sure to conduct a soil test to determine soil properties such as soil type, strength, and
                nutritional levels. Raya can be grown in a variety of soil types, ranging from loam to heavy soil.</p>

            <h2> Cultivation</h2>
            <p>To cultivate one acre, approximately 2 to 2.5 kilogrammes of hybrid seeds are required. A farmer can
                expect a yield of 6 to 8 quintals from one acre of mustard land. The market price for mustard ranges
                between Rs.3800 and 4200 per quintal, depending on the quality of the product. Mustard crops last 120 to
                125 days on average.</p>
                <img class="center" src="../img/mustard_crop/mustad_crop 1.jpg" alt="Mustard" width="350px">
            <h2>Sowing -</h2>
            <p>Mustard is typically planted in the months of September and October. If the mustard crop is pure, seeds
                should be sown by drilling; if it is a mixed crop, seeds should be sown by broadcasting or drilling. For
                even spacing, mix the seeds with fine sand. Seeds should be sown at a depth of no more than 6 cm in the
                soil for best germination. When planting seeds, make sure there is enough moisture in the soil .</p>


            <h2>Fertilizer</h2>
            <p>Soil testing is required for accurate fertiliser dosage. Apply Nitrogen : Phosphorus in the form of Urea
                at 55kg/acre and Superphosphate at 50kg/acre to the toria crop in a 25:8 kg/acre ratio. Only use Potash
                if the soil is deficient in it. Use a N:P:K ratio of 40:12:6 kg/acre for raya and gobhi sarson, with
                Urea at 90kg, SSP at 75kg, and MOP at 10kg per acre. App for rainfed raya crop</p>

            <h2>Irrigation </h2>
            <p>Irrigation should be given prior to sowing the seeds. After sowing the seeds, three irrigations should be
                applied at four-week intervals. A good amount of organic manure should be applied to the soil; this will
                help to conserve soil moisture.</p>

            <h2>Mustard Harvest snd Yielding Process</h2>
            <h3>Harvesting</h3>
            <p>Depending on the variety, the crop matures in 110 to 140 days. Harvest crop when pods turn yellow and
                seeds become hard. Harvest early in the morning to avoid shattering loss. Using a sickle, cut crops
                close to the ground. Harvested crops were stacked for 7-10 days. After proper drying, complete the
                threshing operation.</p>
            <h3>Post Harvesting</h3>
            <p>Mustard plants should be tied into bundles and dried in the sun for 5 to 6 days. Threshing can be
                accomplished by striking the mustard plants with a stick. Winnowing is the process of separating grain
                from husk.</p>
            <h3>Yielding</h3>
            <p>A yield of 400 kg per hectare is to be expected. Yields can reach 1000 kg per hectare with good variety
                and management practices.</p>
