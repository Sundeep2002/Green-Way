            <h1>How To Grow Groundnut Crop</h1>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The Groundnut is additionally called as the nut, is a vegetable yield developed basically for its eatable
                seeds. Groundnut plant is a self-pollinated crop having a place with the subfamily Papilionaceae of the
                Leguminosae family. Groundnut is a significant oilseed and arising as a food crop in India. Natural name
                of groundnut is Arachishypogaea which is gotten from Greek word Arachis implies vegetable and hypogaea
                mean subterranean, alluding to the development of units in the dirt. It comprises of 7.3% N, 1.5% P2O5
                and 1.3% K2O. The nut haulms contain rough protein 8–5%, lipids 1–3% and minerals 9–10%. These are
                utilized as dairy cattle feed either in new or in dried stage or planning roughage or silage. </p>
              
                <img class="center" src="../img/groundnut/groundnut 6.jpg" alt="Groundnut" width="350px">

            <h2>Soil and climate conditions</h2>
            <p>These dirts are undeniably fit to rainfed rabi groundnut. The ideal soil pH for groundnut is 6.0 to 6.5,
                yet a scope of 5.5 to 7.0 is satisfactory. Groundnut does well in the light-finished, free, friable,
                very much depleted, and sandy and sandy topsoil soils which works with simple entrance of stakes and
                their improvement alongside gathering. Mud and substantial soils are not suggested for this yield as
                they meddle in infiltration of stakes and make collecting extremely challenging. It is touchy to soil
                saltiness.</p>

            <h2>Planting depth in Groundnut Cultivation</h2>
            <p>The right planting profundity of 50 to 75 mm guarantees that the plant creates and delivers ideally. A
                seed that develops gradually as an impact of profound planting takes more time to arise and an
                unsatisfactory plant will be created. Seed germination is fast if the dirt dampness and temperature
                range are ideal (above 18°C). Shallow planting of seed (under 50 mm) must be viewed as when enough
                dampness is possible and the environment is wet. In circumstances where dampness isn't restricting
                around 50 mm is the best planting profundity. Seeds should be planted inside 15 cm each in 30 cm
                dispersing between columns. Seeds are to be planted inside 4 cm profundity in the dirt.</p>
                <img class="center" src="../img/groundnut/groundnut 2.jpg" alt="Groundnut" width="350px">

            <h2>Sowing -</h2>
            <p>Sow the rabi crop which is raised on remaining soil dampness in the long stretch of November and the
                inundated summer crop in the second fortnight of January. Plant the seeds in lines at a dividing of
                25cmX 10 cm for bunchy and semi-spreading types. The seed rate is 125 kg part/ha. Use groundnut grower
                or follow drilling behind the furrow for guaranteeing line planting. Guarantee profundity of planting
                inside 5 cm of the dirt under adequate dampness conditions and more profound arrangement at 8-10cm in
                light soils with lacking surface dampness. Follow laddering for better seed-soil contact.</p>


            <h2>Fertilizer</h2>
            <p>Manures and Fertilizers in Groundnut Cultivation:
                Apply 20 kg N and 40 kg every one of P2O5 and K2O/ha in the wrinkles prior to planting and blend in with
                the dirt so that seeds don't come in direct contact with compost, phosphorous ought to be applied in
                type of single super phosphate which likewise meets the sulfur necessity of the yield for example 30kg
                S/ha. Apply very much powdered gypsum @250 kg/ha near the foundation of plants at 20-25 days in the wake
                of planting on one or the other side and fuse in the dirt, with the goal that it stays in top 3 cm of
                soil. This is required on the grounds that calcium must be provided to the creating cases autonomously.
                As developments of calcium from vegetative parts to the cases through gynophores is restricted because
                of limited xylem vessel in the gynophores. This will work on the quantity of units and case filling.
                Aside from 22.3% calcium, gypsum likewise supplies 18.6% sulfur to the dirt. Sulfur inadequacy is
                probably going to foster where groundnut is taken up ceaselessly with high examination manure like urea
                and DAP. In any case, gypsum isn't needed when SSP or Ammonium sulfate is utilized as it likewise
                supplies sulfur.</p>
                <img class="center" src="../img/groundnut/groundnut 1.jpg" alt="Groundnut" width="350px">
            <h2>Irrigation </h2>
            <p>It is prudent to plant the yield with pre-planting water system, or, more than likely apply one post
                planting water system to work with germination. Consequently, give water system at 10-15 days stretch
                contingent on soil and climate conditions. The basic development stages for water system are blooming,
                fixing and unit arrangement. Early season pressure at the vegetative stage is useful for uniform
                blossoming. In level bed technique for planting, apply water system in cross channels made at a time
                frame 5 meter.</p>

            <h2>Groundnut Harvesting Process</h2>
            <p>Groundnuts can be reaped utilizing the stacking technique or precisely. In the mechanical reaping,
                Groundnuts are put in windrows in the wake of being lifted, reaped with a consolidate, and molded in a
                drying unit. In the stacking cycle, the taproots are cut and the plants are gathered and stacked by
                hand. In this system, the plant is released to be eliminated from the dirt by hand. Then, at that point,
                Groundnuts are prepared for picking once the cases can be taken out from the stems without making long
                shreds structure. At this stage, the Groundnut seeds thunder at the point when the cases are shaken and
                seed as of now has a nutty taste.</p>
