      <h1>How To Grow Paddy Crop</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Rice is a cereal grain has a place with the grass group of Graminae and local to the deltas of the incomparable
        Asian streams, the Ganges, the Chang. Paddy plant has a stringy root with the plant developing upto 6 feet tall.
        It has a round jointed stem with leaves being long and pointed. Rice is perhaps the most developed grain Crops
        in India just as in Asian nations and a staple eating routine of a significant piece of India. India is a
        significant community for rice development and utilization. India remains in the second situation after China in
        the creation of rice. Individuals frequently mistake for paddy and rice. Rice, when it is as yet covered by the
        earthy colored body, is known as paddy. Rice fields are likewise called paddy fields or rice paddies. South
        India devours more rice than any piece of India.</p>

      <h2>Soil and climate conditions</h2>
      <h3>Climatic conditions – </h3>
      <p>Paddy can be developed under broadly fluctuating states of elevation and environment. Rice can be developed as
        high as 3000 m (mean ocean level). Fundamentally, Rice crop requires hot and moist climatic conditions for its
        effective development. It additionally needs brilliant daylight with temperature going somewhere in the range of
        20 and 40⁰C. It can endure temperature upto 42⁰C.</p>
      <h3>Soil conditions – </h3>
      <p>Pretty much every sort of soil can be utilized for rice development gave the locale has a significant degree of
        stickiness, adequate precipitation with irrigational offices, and a high temperature. The significant sorts of
        soils for rice development are dark soil, red soil (loamy and yellow), laterite soil, red sandy, terai, slope
        and medium to shallow dark soil. Notwithstanding, profound prolific (wealthy in natural matter) clayey or loamy
        soils which can without much of a stretch be puddled into the mud and foster breaks on drying conditions are
        viewed as ideal for developing rice crop.</p>

       


      <h2>Cultivation –</h2>
      <p>Most farmers practice nursery bed technique. Nursery beds are made involving around 1/twentieth of the complete
        field region. The paddy seeds are planted in the bed. They are prepared inside 25 days of planting in marsh
        regions while in higher heights they require around 55 days to become prepared for transplantation. There are
        four unique acts of development of rice, viz. transplantation strategy, boring technique, broadcast strategy and
        Japanese technique.</p>
      <ul>
        <li> <strong>Transplantation method: </strong> This is the most drilled strategy and this is continued in
          districts where soil has great ripeness and plentiful precipitation/water system. In these techniques, paddy
          seeds are planted in nursery beds. Whenever seeds are developed and seedlings are removed (Usually this will
          occur following 5 weeks), these seedlings can be relocated in the fundamental field. This technique requires
          weighty work and data sources. This technique is end up being the best yielding strategy.</li>
        <li><strong>Japanese method </strong>has been embraced for the high yielding assortment of rice and those that
          need a high measure of manures. Seeds are planted in nursery beds and afterward relocated to the principle
          field. It has shown huge accomplishment for the high yielding assortments.</li>
        <li><strong>Broadcasting method: </strong>: In this strategy, Seeds are planted by hand and this technique is
          reasonable in regions where the dirt isn't prolific and lands are dry. This requires least work and
          information sources. This technique creates exceptionally less yield when contrasted with other planting
          strategies.</li>
        <li><strong>Drilling method </strong>is selective to India. In this technique, one individual furrows an opening
          in the land and the other individual sows the seed. Bull is the most generally utilized 'individual' to furrow
          the land.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Sowing</h2>
      <p>The primary frameworks continued in rice development are 'dry', 'semi-dry' and 'Wet'. Fundamentally, the dry
        and semi-dry frameworks of development relies upon downpours and don't have strengthening water system offices
        while, in wet development framework, the rice crop is developed with guaranteed and plentiful water supply
        either by downpour or by water system. </p>
      <p>Dry and Semi-dry framework: for this arrangement of rice crop the field ought to have great tilth that can be
        accomplished by several ploughings and nerve racking. Recorded ought to be enhanced with ranch yard fertilizer
        (FMY)/manure DISTRIBUTED consistently fourteen days to about a month prior planting or planting. The seeds ought
        to be planted either by communicating or boring technique and line planting would help in weeding and
        intercultural tasks. The column to push dispersing if there should arise an occurrence of drill planting
        strategy is 20 cm to 25 cm. </p>
      <p>Wet framework: When following this arrangement of development strategy, the land ought to be furrowed
        completely and puddled with 3cm to 5 cm of standing water in the field. If there should arise an occurrence of
        clayey or loamy soil the profundity should be 10 cm. Post puddling the land is evened out in order to guarantee
        uniform water conveyance. Seedlings are planted or relocated subsequent to evening out.</p>

      <h2>Fertilizer</h2>
      <p>Manures and Fertilizers in Rice Cultivation:
        As rice crop responds very well to manure and chemicals, it is essential to fo for proper manures and
        fertilizers in paddy cultivation. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Farm yard manure/Compost: 10 to 15 cartloads</li>
        <li>Nitrogen: 100 to 150 Kg/Ha.</li>
        <li>Phosphorous: 50 to 60 Kg P2O5/Ha.</li>
        <li>Potash: 40 to 50 Kg KO/Ha.</li>
        <li>Zinc Sulphate: 25 Kg/Ha.</li>
        <li>Green Manuring Crops: Sanai, Dhaincha and Moong/Urad.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Irrigation</h2>
      <p>With water shortage turning into a significant issue in agribusiness, as of now there are contemplates going on
        dribble water system for paddy development. Notwithstanding, the well known System of Rice Intensification "SRI"
        technique utilizes around 120 to 150 lakhs liters for every hectare to create 7 tons of rice. During the
        underlying time frame, the paddy field requires plentiful water supply particularly in wet terrains. Water
        supply ought to be diminished occasionally prior to reaping the harvest.</p>

      <h2>Paddy Harvest and Yielding</h2>
      <h3>Harvest</h3>
      <p>Collecting on time is fundamental to abstain from shedding of grains in rice cultivating. The later phase of
        grain-aging is a lack of hydration cycle and development is rushed when water is removed from the field at the
        solidifying phase of the rice crop. For reaping, early or medium assortments, 26 to 30 days in the wake of
        blooming and 36 to 40 days in the wake of blossoming if there should arise an occurrence of tall assortments are
        suggested. Field paddy is to be collected when the dampness content of the rice grain is 20 to 25 %. Steady
        drying ought to be done in the shed for better recuperation </p>
      <h3>Yielding</h3>
      <p>The yield relies upon numerous variables like assortment, soil type, development strategy, and homestead the
        executives rehearses. With great assortment, a normal yield of 2500 kg/ha can be accomplished. The yield of rice
        in India is a lot of lower than the creation yield of some other Asian nations.</p>
