            <h1>How To Grow Maize Crop</h1>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Maize or Indian corn (called corn in some countries) is Zea mays, a member of the grass family Poaceae.
                It is a cereal grain which was first grown by people in ancient Central America. Approximately 1 billion
                tonnes are harvested every year. However, little of this maize is eaten directly by humans. The crop was
                introduced to Europe in the sixteenth century, from where it spread to Africa and Asia. It is now one of
                the most widely-grown crops around the world in both temperate and tropical regions.</p>

            <h2>Soil and climate conditions</h2>
            <h3>Climate Conditions -</h3>
            <p>Rainfall: Maize is grown mostly in regions having annual rainfall between 60 cm to 110 cm.</p>
            <p>In semi-arid climates- Deep soils (Heavy Texture)</p>
            <p> In sub humid climates- Sand Loam soils</p>

            <p> Temperature of 18 to 23 degree Celsius for deposition and 28 degree Celsius temperature is considered
                good for growth and development .
            </p>
            <h3>Soil Conditions -</h3>
            <p>Maize can be grown in all types of soil. But for good growth and productivity of maize, loam and medium
                to heavy soil having adequate amount of bacteria and proper drainage is suitable . Maize can be grown
                successfully in variety of soils ranging from loamy sand to clay loam. However, soils with good organic
                matter content having high water holding capacity with neutral pH are considered good for higher
                productivity . The general requirement for maize cultivation is as follows:</p>
                <img class="center" src="../img/maize/maize 5.jpg" alt="Maize" width="350px">
            <h2>Field Preperation -</h2>
            <p>2-3 shallow tillage operations during summer season are essential. Deep ploughing is also helpful to
                control weeds & for efficient moisture conservation.Plough the field five to six times to get fine
                tilth. Spread 12.5 tons of FYM ha-1 or composted coir pith and apply ten packets of Azospirillum in the
                field.
                Prepare ridges and furrows with 45 cm spacing.
                Formation of ridges and furrows enables saving of irrigation water . Conventional land preparation
                should target the following aspects:
                To loosen the soil and to form a fine tilth-this aids good seed-soil contact and emergence.
                To control weeds and start on a weed free seedbed.
                To conserve moisture and improve drainage and water movement in the soil.
            </p>

            <h2>Irrigation</h2>
            <p>Furrow irrigation is best used for irrigating row crops such as maize, vegetables and trees. Border
                irrigation is particularly suitable for close growing crops such as alfalfa, but border irrigation can
                also be used for row crops and trees.
                Maize crop is sensitive to both moisture stress and excessive moisture, hence regulate irrigation
                according to the requirement. Ensure optimum moisture availability during the most critical phase (45 to
                65 days after sowing); otherwise yield will be reduced by a considerable extent
                Regulate irrigation according to the following growth phase of the crop.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Germination & establishment phase : 1 to 14 days</li>
                <li>Vegetative phase : 15 to 39 days</li>
                <li>Flowering phase : 40 to 65 days</li>
                <li>Maturity phase : 66 to 95 days</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>Sowing -</h2>
            <p>Maize crop is usually cultivated in India, from June to July, Sept to Oct and Jan to Feb seasons. For
                seed production, sowing during Nov to Dec is suitable since seed maturity will not coincide with the
                rainy season..</p>


            <h2>Fertilizer</h2>
            <p>Manures and Fertilizers in Maize Cultivation:
                Other than Farm Yard Manure applied at the time of land preparation, should apply inorganic fertilizers
                like 470 kg of superphosphate, 200 kg of urea, and 180 kg of potash per ha as a basal dose. 20 days
                after sowing, should apply 50 to 60 kg of urea and at 40 days after sowing 120 kg of urea and 50 kg of
                potash as a topdressing.</p>

            <h2>Irrigation </h2>
            <p>As soon as sowing is done, immediate irrigation is required in the field. Subsequently, give life
                irrigation on the third or fourth day and based on the soil type and season. (It may not be required in
                rainy season). Usually for maize crop, up to 25 to 30 days, less number of irrigation is recommended,
                afterward, it is required to irrigate once in a week. During the early stage of this crop, water
                stagnation should be avoided and should have good drainage.</p>
                <img class="center" src="../img/maize/maize 6.jpg" alt="Maize" width="350px">
            <h2>Diseases occurred in crop:</h2>
            <p>Main diseases in maize farming are downy mildew and leaf spot.</p>
            <p><strong>Downy mildew:</strong>To control this, remove the affected plants. Spray Metalaxyl 72 WP @ 1 kg
                per hectare, or Mancozeb 1 kg per hectare, 20 days after sowing.</p>
            <p><strong>Leaf spot:</strong>To control this, spray Captain or Mancozeb kg per hectare when the disease
                intensity is high.</p>
            <p>Usually, insect attack is very low in maize crop. In young plants, only shoot fly effects and stem borer
                affects the shoot after 20 to 30 days after sowing, to control this, apply carbofuran granules @ 8
                kg/acre @ 2 granules per each plant.</p>


            <h2>Maize Harvesting and Yielding Process</h2>
            <p>Harvesting should be done when the crop outer cover of the cob turns from green to white color.
                Harvesting can be done by hand. Machines are available to separate the seeds.</p>
            <p>Again yield depends on the field management and seed variety, the quality seed can yield up to 2500 kg
                per hectare.</p>
