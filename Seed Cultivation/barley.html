            <h1>How To Grow Barley Crop</h1>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) is popularly called "Jau" in Hindi and is one of the most important types of
                grain after rice, wheat and maize. In India, this plant is grown in temperate tropical regions as a
                summer crop and in tropical regions as a winter crop. Barley also plays an important role in industrial
                consumption. </p>
                <img class="center" src="../img/barley/Barley crop image 4.jpg" alt="Barley" width="350px">

            <h2>Soil and climate conditions</h2>
            <h3>Climatic conditions – </h3>
            <p>Barley can be grown as both summer and winter crops. This crop is mainly grown as a rabi seasonal crop in
                India. This culture requires a temperature of 12 ° C to 16 ° C when growing and about 30 ° C to 32 ° C
                when mature. This plant is very sensitive to frost in every growth phase. </p>
            <h3>Soil conditions – </h3>
            <p> Barley can be grown on a variety of soils including saline, sodium, and lighter soils. However, this
                culture thrives best on medium-heavy sandy to loamy soils that have a neutral to medium salt reaction.
                Fertility Acid soils are not suitable for growing barley. </p>

            <h2>Cultivation –</h2>
            <p>Most farmers practice nursery bed technique. Nursery beds are made involving around 1/twentieth of the
                complete
                field region. The paddy seeds are planted in the bed. They are prepared inside 25 days of planting in
                marsh
                regions while in higher heights they require around 55 days to become prepared for transplantation.
                There are
                four unique acts of development of rice, viz. transplantation strategy, boring technique, broadcast
                strategy and
                Japanese technique.</p>

            <h2>Sowing</h2>
            <p>The best sowing method in barley cultivation is sowing with a seed drill or sowing the seeds with a
                chonga attached to a desip flight. Line sowing with a seeder is more effective. Below is the amount of
                seed and the distance in the barley. </p>


            <h2>Fertilizer</h2>
            <p>Manures and Fertilizers in Barley Cultivation:
                For irrigated crops, half of 'N' and the full dose of 'P' should be used as the base dose and the
                remaining half of 'N' should be used after the first watering or 1. are applied one month after the crop
                is planted. </p>

            <h2>Irrigation</h2>
            <p> 2 to 3 irrigation systems are sufficient for optimal performance in barley cultivation. The first
                watering should be done at the beginning of the crown root, 25-30 days after sowing. The second watering
                should be done when the panicle emerges, 6575 days after sowing.</p>

            <h2>Barley Harvest and Yielding</h2>
            <h3>Harvest</h3>
            <p>The barley harvest is normally ready for harvest at the end of March or mid-April. a property of
                absorbing moisture from the atmosphere, so the harvest should be stored in a dry place. Mechanical
                harvesting is preferred when growing barley. </p>
            <h3>Yielding</h3>
            <p>Harvest yield depends on the variety, farm management practices and weather conditions. An average yield
                of 18-20 quintals / acre is expected.</p>
