            <h1>How To Grow Saybean Crop</h1>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Soybeans are known as the "GOLDEN BEAN" because they belong to the legume crop family and are primarily
                indigenous to East Asia. “Glycine max” is its botanical name. Soybean is an extremely nutritive and
                protein-rich food. They are used as oilseeds because they contain approximately 18% oil. Soybeans are
                grown in similar conditions to corn.</p>
                <img class="center" src="../img/soybean/soyabean (4).jpg" alt="Soybean" width="350px">
            <h2>Soil and climate conditions</h2>
            <h3>Climate Condition</h3>
            <p>Soybean grows well in warm, moist climates. Temperatures ranging from 26 to 32°C appear to be ideal for
                most soybean varieties. Soybean farming requires soil temperatures of 16°C or higher to support rapid
                germination and vigorous seedling growth. A lower temperature may cause flowering to be delayed.</p>
            <h3>Soil Conditions:</h3>
            <p>Soybean cultivation requires well-drained, fertile loamy soils with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.5. Soybean
                seed germination is inhibited by saline and sodic soils. Water logging harms crops, so good soil
                drainage is essential during the rainy season.</p>

            <h2> Cultivation</h2>
            <h2>Sowing -</h2>
            <p>The best time to plant soybeans is in mid-June. Soybean farming should be done in lines 45 cm – 60 cm
                apart using a seed driller or behind the plough. The plant-to-plant distance should be kept between 4
                and 5 cm. Under ideal moisture conditions, the sowing depth of soybean seed should be no more than 3 cm
                – 4 cm.</p>

                <img class="center" src="../img/soybean/soyabean (6).jpg" alt="Soybean" width="350px">
            <h2>Fertilizer</h2>
            <p>Soybeans can use nitrogen from the atmosphere, but this is insufficient. As a result, the crop receives
                10-15% of its total nitrogen requirement. It is sufficient to apply 12.5 kg of nitrogen per acre and 32
                kg of phosphorus per acre. Potash is only required if a deficiency is detected.</p>

            <h2>Irrigation </h2>
            <p>During the Kharif season, the soybean crop generally does not require any irrigation. However, if there
                is a long drought at the time of pod filling, only one irrigation will be required. During the rainy
                season, ensure that crop soil has adequate drainage to avoid water logging. Spring crops would
                necessitate 6 to 7 irrigations.</p>

            <h2>Soybean Harvest snd Yielding Process</h2>
            <p>The adulthood of soybean crop length levels from 50 to a hundred forty five days relying at the sorts
                used for cultivation. It have to be a indication of adulthood while the leaves flip yellow and drop and
                soybean pods dry out very quickly. There could be a speedy lack of moisture from the seed. At harvesting
                time, the moisture content material withinside the seeds have to be approximately 15 %. Harvesting have
                to be finished through breaking the stalks at the floor degree or hand, or with sickle. Threshing have
                to be finished with the mechanical soybean thresher. Crop yield relies upon at the style of seed
                cultivated .An common yield 18 to 35 quintals/ha may be expected.</p>
