            <h1>How To Grow Cardamom Crop</h1>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Cardamom popularly known as “ILAICHI” or “ELAICHI” in India and referred to as ‘Queen of Spices’. It is
                actually a dried fruit of a tall perennial plant. It is part of the ‘Zingiberaceae’ family. In India,
                Cardamom is cultivated in Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamilnadu. Because of its aroma and flavor, Cardamom is
                one of the most expensive spices in the world. India is one of the biggest producers of cardamom in the
                world. The useful part of cardamom is the dried mature fruit. It is usually termed as a capsule.
                Cardamom is used for flavoring cakes, curries, and bread and for other culinary purposes. It is also
                used as a masticatory and for flavoring coffee and confectionery. </p>

            <h2>Soil and climate conditions</h2>
            <h3>Climatic conditions – </h3>
            <p>Cardamom plants are naturally seen in the Western Ghats hilly tracts. Commercial farming of Cardamom is
                found in the Western Ghats as this area is more suitable for its cultivation. Ideal temperature range
                for this crop is 10° to 35°C. Small cardamom is well grown in areas where annual rainfall of 1,500 mm to
                4,000 mm is received. This crop can be grown about 600 m to 1,500 m above the sea level. </p>
            <h3>Soil conditions – </h3>
            <p> Small Cardamom is usually thrived well in soils with rich in organic matter. The best-suited soil for
                small Cardamom commercial cultivation is loamy soils rich in humus. Ideal soil PH range of 4.5 to 7.0 is
                best suited for Cardamom plants growth. </p>

            <h2>Cultivation –</h2>
            <p>Small Cardamom is mainly propagated by seeds and vegetative propagation. Vegetative propagation is best
                compared to seed propagation. In vegetative propagation, the suckers free from diseases and pests are
                normally used. In commercial cultivation of small Cardamom, micro-propagation using tissue culture
                technique can also be practiced. Small Cardamom seedlings are raised in nursery beds for 10 to 18 months
                and they should be moved to main field plantation.</p>
                <img class="center" src="../img/caradmom/cardamom 3.jpg" alt="Cardamom" width="350px">
            <h2>Planting –</h2>
            <p>About 10-18 months old seedlings are used for planting in the field. Preparation of land consist of
                clearing all under growth and thinning out excess shade trees or branches to have an even or head
                canopy. Pits of 45x45x30 cm size may be dug in April-May and filled with a mixture of top soil and
                compost or well rotten farmyard manure. Close planting (2mx1m) is advisable along the contour</p>
            <p>The planting is carried out during the rainy season commencing from June. The time for planting in
                low-lying areas is ideal after the cessation of heavy monsoon showers. Well-formed planting material
                results in more shoots/clump and early bearing. The section of rhizome is placed in small depressions in
                the prepared, filled trenches or pits and covered with soil and mulch while the leafy shoots are placed
                almost parallel to the soil surface. New shoots arise from the rhizome and constitute a clump.</p>
            <p>The best establishment is obtained when planting is carried out in august. Seedlings are planted up to
                collar region in the depression</p>


            <h2>Fertilizer</h2>
            <p>Manures and Fertilizers in Cardamom Cultivation:
                Recommended fertilizer NPK dose is 75:75:150 kg/ha. Application of lime enhances nitrification and
                corrects soil acidity, resulting in good plant growth. A fertilizer NPK dose is 120:120:240 kg /ha to
                the high-density Cardamom planting of (about 5,000 plants/ha) is recommended for Karnataka, whereas an
                NPK dose of 30:60:30kg/hectare is usually recommended in Kerala. For the split application of
                fertilizer, Under the rainfed condition, fertilizer can be applied in 2 splits. The first application of
                fertilizer helps in capsules development and in the production of suckers, whereas the second
                application helps in suckers and initiation of panicles. In an irrigated condition of the plantation,
                fertilizer application in four split doses at a quarterly interval is beneficial. Avoid applying
                fertilizers in heavy rains.</p>

            <h2>Barley Harvest and Yielding</h2>
            <h3>Harvest</h3>
            <p>The cardamom comes to bearing in the 2-3 years after planting. The fruits mature at 30-40 days intervals,
                necessitating 5-6 pickings. Harvesting season is October-November. Capsules are harvested just short of
                full ripeness. Over mature fruits split on drying floor, whereas the unripe fruits shrivel on drying. An
                average yield of dry capsules from a well- maintained plantation comes to 500kg/ha. Soaking freshly
                harvested green cardamom capsules in 2% washing soda solution for 10 minutes prior to drying help retain
                original green color during drying. </p>
            <h3>Yielding</h3>
            <p>An average yield of dry cardamom capsules from a well-grown plantation would be around 450 to 500 kg/ha.
                Yield may vary from soil to soil and type of Variety.</p>
