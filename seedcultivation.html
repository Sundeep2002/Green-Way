      <p>Among all seed cultivation is a lot more important
        Seeds are of immense biological and economic importance. They contain high protein, starch and oil reserves that
        help in the early stages of growth and development in a plant. These reserves are what make many cereals and
        legumes major food sources for a large proportion of the world's inhabitants.
        This triggers root growth to allow the seed to get more water. Then, the shoots develop and grow towards the sun
        above ground. Seed germination is important for natural plant growth and growing crops for human use.
