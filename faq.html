            <p>Agriculture is the largest provider of livelihood in rural India. It contributes 25 percent to India’s GDP. It is still dependent primarily on the monsoons. The growth in agricultural production has been stagnant for the past several years. The drought in north and western parts in FY09 created shortages in supply of food grains.</p>

                <span>What is soil health?</span>
                <i class="fas fa-chevron-up"></i>
            </button>
            <p>Soil health, also known as soil quality, refers to the soil's ability to function as an ecosystem for plants, animals, and humans. The term "soil health" is used by farmers to remind them that the soil includes living organisms that aid in the production of food.</p>

            <button>
                <span>What effect does farming have on the health of the soil?</span>
                <i class="fas fa-chevron-up"></i>
            </button>
            <p>Soil health is influenced in three ways by farming:
                Nutrient supplementation. To increase crop yields, farmers frequently add nutrients to the soil. However, some of these nutrients and fertilisers can interfere with the ability of soil microorganisms to generate natural substances that crops require.

            </button>
            <p>Pesticides are chemicals that are used to keep hazardous plants and animals from harming your crops. Pesticides are divided into categories:
                Insecticides. Insecticides are chemicals that kill or repel insects.
                Herbicides. Weeds and other hazardous plants are killed or repelled by these compounds.
                Rodenticides. Rodents are killed or repelled by these compounds.
                Bactericides. A substance which kills bacteria.

            <button>
                <span>What are the dangers of herbicides and pesticides.</span>
                <i class="fas fa-chevron-up"></i>
            </button>
            <p>Both the environment and people's health are endangered by herbicides and pesticides.
                Because of runoff, leeching, and volatilization, these compounds are hazardous to the environment.
                These hazardous chemicals are sprayed on crops before being washed into rivers, ponds, and oceans, poisoning the entire body of water.
                Pesticides also have the potential to harm the nervous system, the reproductive system, and the endocrine system

                <i class="fas fa-chevron-up"></i>
            </button>
            <p>Factors affecting crop production: 
                Several factors affected the crop production. ... A crop producer may not manage these 7 Factors; these are temperature, solar radiation, strong winds, inundation or flood, rainfall, carbon dioxide and altitude.
                Nutrients. Crop production necessitates the use of 18 distinct nutrients. Protein synthesis, photosynthesis, and root, shoot, and leaf development are all affected by nutrients.
