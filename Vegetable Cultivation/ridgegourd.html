            <h1>How To Grow Ridge Gourd Crop</h1>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Ridge gourd is an important Indian vegetable crop that can be grown all year. Ridge gourd is a member of
                the Cucurbitaceae family. The Ridge gourd vegetable is used as a vegetable in its green stage, and the
                leaves with stem are used as a vegetable. It is a well-known vegetable in southern and eastern India.
            </p>

            <h2>Soil and climate conditions</h2>
            <h3>Climatic conditions – </h3>
            <p>Ridge gourd thrives in warm, humid climates; the ideal temperature range for Ridge gourd cultivation is
                25° to 35° C.</p>
            <h3>Soil conditions – </h3>
            <p> The soil or main field should be thoroughly prepared with 4 to 5 ploughings, and a pH range of 6.5 to
                7.5 is ideal for Ridge gourd cultivation. This vegetable crop necessitates adequate drainage. Applying
                organic matter or farmyard manure can increase vegetable yield and quality (FMY).</p>

            <h2>Cultivation –</h2>
            <p>Shallow cultivation is preferred during the early stages of plant growth. For better creeping, the plants
                should be given appropriate support in the form of bamboo sticks.</p>


            <h2>Sowing -</h2>
            <p>Ridge gourd seeds are planted by dibbling at 1.5 m to 2.0 m X 1.0 m to 1.5 m. In each pit, plant three
                seeds. Thin to 2 healthy seedlings after germination. Poly bags can also be used to sow the seeds. 2
                seeds per bag are ideal, and 2 weeks after germination, they can be planted in the main field at 2
                seedlings per pit.</p>

            <h2>Fertilizer</h2>
            <p>Manures and Fertilizers in Ridge Gourd Cultivation:
                Farm Yard 40 to 50 cartloads well decomposed Manure should be applied during the soil or field
                preparation process. Using the split application method, apply a fertiliser dose of 250:100:100 kg NPK /
                ha throughout the Ridge gourd cropping period.

            <h2>Ridge Gourd Harvest and Yielding</h2>
            <p>For the primary harvest, Ridge gourd normally takes 2 weeks after flowering or pollination. Ridge gourd
                vines want help for vertical increase except you select them to creep at the ground. Ridge gourd is in
                particular grown from seeds and calls for well-drained, humus-wealthy soil for immediate germination.
                Ridge gourd calls for an excellent quantity of sunlight (as a minimum 6 to eight hours in keeping with
                day). Ridge gourds are without difficulty grown withinside the pot, withinside the balcony, at the
                terrace, withinside the backyard. Growing Ridge gourds interior isn't always tough furnished you ensure
                that the developing necessities are furnished. The huge quantities of cucurbitacin in Ridge gourds cause
                them to sour in flavor. To develop the Ridge gourds a home, the best pit have to be dug and compost have
                to be introduced to the pit. you may immediately seed or can transplant the nursery-grown seedlings. The
                motive for Ridge gourd plant is flowering however NOT fruiting is because of all male plant life or
                calls for pollination. Ridge gourd plant life begin losing whilst there may be no enough water or
                overwatering. Sometimes it can appear because of nutrient and fertilizer deficiency withinside the soil.
                It calls for low funding and it may be grown yearlong with excessive yields in quick duration.</p>
