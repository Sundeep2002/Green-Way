            <h1>How To Grow Apple Crop</h1>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Radish is a famous vegetable in each tropical in addition to temperate regions. Being a brief developing
                crop, it could be effortlessly planted as a partner crop or intercrop among the rows of the opposite
                vegetables. It also can be planted on ridges, isolating one plot from another. It is cultivated
                throughout India, in particular close to the metropolis markets. Radish originated probable in China. In
                India, it appears to were cultivated from historic times. It become famous many of the historic
                Egyptians and Greeks. The botanical call of radish is “Raphanus sativus”. The enlarged suitable for
                eating roots are fusiform and range in colour from white to red.</p>

            <h2>Soil and climate conditions</h2>
            <h3>Climatic conditions – </h3>
            <p>Usually, radish is a groovy season crop however the Asiatic types can withstand extra warmness than the
                European or temperate types. It attains pleasant flavor, texture, and length at 10 to 15°C. Long days,
                in addition to excessive temperature, result in bolting with out good enough root formation. During the
                recent weather, the basis turns into hard and smelly earlier than achieving the safe to eat length and,
                therefore, the crop ought to be harvested at the same time as younger and small in length. The radish is
                extra smelly at a better temperature. Pungency decreases with a cooler temperature.</p>
            <h3>Soil conditions – </h3>
            <p> Radish grows in any well-drained, loose soil. Till the soil to a depth of 6-8 inches to make it loose
                and conducive to radish growth. To enrich it with organic matter, add a layer of farmyard manure (FMY)
                or garden compost. Radish farming requires soils with a pH range of 6.0 – 7.5.Radish grows in any

            <h2>Cultivation –</h2>
            <p>Since radish is a fab season crop, its cultivation is ready all through the iciness season withinside the
                plains. It may be sown at any time among September and January in northern plains because it isn't
                always affected both via way of means of frost or via way of means of extraordinarily bloodless climate
                condition. It is grown from March to August withinside the hills. In the areas wherein summer time
                season is mild, it is able to be grown all through the yr, besides for some months of summer time
                season. In Bangalore, radish roots are to be had for 8-10 months of the yr however the quality suitable
                for eating roots are to be had all through November-December only. The temperate sorts are normally now
                no longer planted until October.</p>

            <h2>Sowing -</h2>
            <p>Radish is commonly grown on ridges to facilitate precise root production. It is grown, as a unmarried
                crop or as a associate crop. The plant rows or ridges approximately 22 cm excessive are saved
                approximately forty five cm apart, while the flora withinside the rows are saved eight cm apart. The
                European or temperate types, as they want nearer spacing, may be sown 20 -30 cm apart. Generally, the
                seed sowing is completed 1.15 cm deep. The seed is sown with the aid of using any of the 2 techniques
                specifically line sowing and broadcasting. There are sorts of Sowing in Radish Farming. Line sowing:
                Seed is blended with sand or soil withinside the ratio of 1:four and located in a row with the aid of
                using hand, over the ridges after which protected with Soil. Broadcasting: Seed is blended with sand or
                soil in a ratio of 1:four and scattered over the field, as whilst possible, observed with the aid of
                using planking. Plants are spaced after germination at the same time as hoeing.</p>




            <h2>Fertilizer</h2>
            <p>Manures and Fertilizers in Radish Cultivation:
                The farmyard manure ought to be blended up very well on the time of subject preparation, while the
                entire doses of potassic phosphatic and one-1/2 of dose of nitrogenous fertilizers may be carried out
                withinside the rows earlier than sowing. The ultimate 1/2 of dose of nitrogenous fertilizers ought to be
                carried out as a pinnacle dressing along side irrigation while the plant life begin developing
                vigorously. Radish is a quick-developing crop, as a result the soil ought to be exceedingly wealthy in
                plant nutrients. Add farmyard manure 25-forty tonnes, nitrogen 18-50 kg withinside the shape of ammonium
                sulfate, phosphorus 50 kg withinside the shape of superphosphate and potash 50 kg withinside the shape
                of Muriate of potash for one hectare of the subject. Regular weeding in Radish Farming is important to
                peer the boom of the weeds. In the wet season, weedings can be required to preserve the boom of weeds
                below control. Tok E -25 (Nitrofan 25%) carried out as pre-emergence, controls each monocot in addition
                to dicot weeds in radish subject.

            <h2>Radish Harvest and Yielding</h2>
            <h3>Harvest</h3>
            <p>In Radish Farming, harvesting time is an critical component in developing radish. If you go away radish
                withinside the floor for too lengthy then it turns into inedible. Generally, the crop may be harvested
                from 3rdweek of sowing seeds. Matured radish may be diagnosed with the aid of using huge leaves above
                the floor on 2-three cm extensive top. Pull the mature radish out of the floor and reduce off the
                luxurious inexperienced top. Store the harvested crop withinside the fridge and use inside a week. In
                order to store seeds for subsequent season go away the radish withinside the floor and allow it flower
                and fruit.</p>
            <h3>Yielding</h3>
            <p>In 25-30 days, European or temperate varieties produce 80-100 quintals of roots per hectare. whereas
                Asiatic improved Radish varieties yield 150-250 quintals of roots per hectare in 40-60 days.</p>
