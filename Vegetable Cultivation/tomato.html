            <h1>How To Grow Tomato Crop</h1>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Tomato, is an herbaceous annual withinside the own circle of relatives Solanaceae grown for its fit to be
                eaten fruit. The plant may be erect with quick stems or vine-like with long, spreading stems. The stems
                are protected in coarse hairs and the leaves are organized spirally. The tomato plant produces yellow
                flowers, that could grow to be a cyme of 3–12, and generally a spherical fruit (berry) that is fleshy,
                smoothed skinned and may be red, pink, purple, brown, orange or yellow in color. The tomato plant can
                develop 0.7–2 m (2.3–6.6 ft) in top and as an annual, is harvested after handiest one developing season.
            </p>

            <h2>Soil and climate conditions</h2>
            <h3>Climatic conditions – </h3>
            <p>It prospers properly in temperature 10C to 30C with most advantageous variety of temperature is 21-24C.
                The imply temperature beneathneath 16C and above 27C aren't desirable. The plant would not resist frost,
                it calls for low to medium rainfall, and does properly below common month-to-month temperature of 21 to
                23C.</p>
            <h3>Soil conditions – </h3>
            <p> Tomato vegetation thrive in nearly all styles of soil. Fertile sandy loam is exceptional acceptable for
                the Tomato manufacturing of early crops. Loam and sticky soils have more water retaining ability and
                extra appropriate for longer manufacturing seasons. Soils wealthy in natural rely and mineral vitamins
                are appropriate for growing crop yields. Soil with a pH degree of five.five to 7.zero is maximum
                appropriate for Tomato manufacturing. </p>

            <h2>Cultivation –</h2>
            <p>Seedlings are transplanted in furrows in mild soils and on aspect of the ridges in case of heavy soils. A
                pre-soaking irrigation is given 3-four days previous to transplanting. Before planting seedlings have to
                be dipped in an answer organized via way of means of Nuvacron (15ml) and Dithane M - 45 (25g) in 10
                litres of water for 5-6 minutes. Transplanting have to otherwise be accomplished withinside the evening.
            </p>
            <img class="center" src="../img/tomato/tomato (1).jpeg" alt="Tomato" width="350px">

            <h2>Sowing -</h2>
            <p>Sow Tomato seeds six weeks (for determinate varieties) to 8 weeks (for indeterminate varieties) earlier
                than the final frost date on your area. The fine planting medium for Tomato is a sterile seed-beginning
                mix. Good drainage and aeration are vital for beginning Tomato seeds. Plant seed ¼ inches deep in
                shallow residences or mobileular packs and preserve soil temperature withinside the variety of 24-29°C.
                After transplanting, hold seedlings at a decrease temperature at night, 10-13°C, to sell in advance
                flowering in a few varieties. Day temperatures have to upward thrust to 24-29°C to sell speedy growth.
                If fluorescent lighting are used, hold the seedlings no in addition than 2 to four inches beneath the
                lamps, otherwise, seedlings might also additionally end up leggy.</p>


            <h2>Fertilizer</h2>
            <p>Manures and Fertilizers in Tomato Cultivation:
                The fertilizer dose relies upon upon the fertility of soil and quantity of natural manure implemented to
                the crop. For a very good yield, 15-20 tonnes of well-decomposed FYM is included into the soil.
                Generally, utility of one hundred twenty kg N, eighty kg P2O5 and 50 kg K2O in keeping with hectare is
                suggested for buying most advantageous yield. Half dose of N and complete dose of P and K is given on
                the time of planting. The stability 1/2 of of N is given as pinnacle dressing 30 days after
                transplanting. </p>

            <h2>Irrigation</h2>
            <p> Tomato may be very touchy to water application. Heavy irrigation furnished after an extended spell of
                drought reasons cracking of the fruits. Hence it need to be avoided. Light irrigation need to accept
                3-four days after transplanting. Irrigation periods need to be in keeping with soil kind and rainfall,
                irrigation need to accept 7-eight days c program languageperiod all through kharif, all through rabi
                10-12 days and 5-6 days all through summer.</p>

            <h2>Tomato Harvest and Yielding</h2>
            <p>Once Tomato flora begin ripening and test vines daily. Cut or lightly twist off Tomato culmination,
                assisting the vine on the identical time. For first-rate flavor, depart the culmination at the Tomato
                flora for so long as possible. At the primary signal of heavy frost, harvest all Tomato culmination.
                Green culmination will ultimately ripen whilst saved in a heat region out of direct sunlight. Tomatoes
                require ninety to140 days to mature from seed; 60 to ninety days from transplanting, relying at the
                variety. The common Tomato yield is set 30 tonnes in keeping with acre.</p>
