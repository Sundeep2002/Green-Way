            <h1>How To Grow Drum Stick Crop</h1>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Drumstick is one among the notable vegetable crops in India. Drumstick is that the most generally
                cultivated species of the genus Moringa comes from the Moringaceae family. although the origin of
                drumsticks is India, because of their medicative uses it's reached alternative countries also. Drumstick
                tree, Moringa is documented for its multi-purpose attributes, wide adaptability, and easy establishment.
                Its leaves, pods, and flowers are all jam-choked with nutrients for each humans and animals. </p>
                <img class="center" src="../img/drumstick/drumstick (5).jpeg" alt="Drumstick" width="350px">
            <h2>Soil and climate conditions</h2>
            <h3>Climatic conditions – </h3>
            <p>The greatness of drumstick is, it can survive in drought conditions with negligible water requirement.
                they will thrive in poor soils also. the recent and wet climate is appropriate for growth and dry
                climate for flowering. The temperature of twenty five to thirty Degrees uranologist is suitable for
                flowering within the drumstick. </p>
            <h3>Soil conditions – </h3>
            <p> The Moringa/Drumstick plant grows best in well-drained sandy or loamy soil with a rather acid pH scale
                of 6.2 to neutral 7.0. It can tolerate poor soil as well as coastal areas. .</p>

            <h2>Cultivation: </h2>
            <p>If planting an oversized plot it's suggested to initial plow the land. before planting a seed or
                seedling, dig a planting pit concerning 50cm in-depth and also the same in width. This planting hole
                serves to loosen the soil and helps to retain moisten within the root zone, sanctionative the seedlings’
                roots to develop rapidly. Compost or manure at the speed of 5kg per pit is mixed with the recent soil
                round the pit and wont to fill Inferno. Avoid mistreatment the soil taken out of the pit for this
                purpose: fresh topsoil contains useful microbes that may promote simpler root growth. </p>

            <h2>Propogation –</h2>
            <p>There are 3 varieties of propagation in drumstick farming. </p>
            <p><strong>Seed Propagation: </strong>This methodology is appropriate for annual vascular plant types. Seeds
                are planted in 2 to three-centimeter depth in every pit. below regular and correct irrigation,
                germination happens when eight to ten days. </p>
            <p><strong>Stem cutting:</strong>This method is suitable for perennial cultivar types. once trees stop
                manufacturing pods, stop the branches for growing new trees and this may promote recent growth. Cut
                branches that are five to twelve cm in diameter and one hundred to a hundred and fifty cm long for
                planting in each pit. Application of cow dung on the highest finish of the cutting can defend the
                cut-branches from pests and diseases at the time of planting. for correct root and plant growth, place
                common fraction a part of the cut-branch within the soil pit.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Nursery: </strong>Seeds are planted in nursery beds or in fifteen x seven cm polythene baggage
                within the months might to June. Soil should be mixed with organic manure at 2:1 ratio. when eight to
                ten days the method of germination takes place and thirty to forty days previous seedlings are prepared
                for movement in the mainland. concerning 600 to 700 grams of seeds are needed for a square measure land.
                it's suggested to lift a number of additional plants in polyethylene baggage for the aim of gap filling
                within the mainland. </p>

            <h2>Fertilizer</h2>
            <p>Manures and Fertilizers in Drum Sticks Cultivation:
                when the third month of sowing or planting, one hundred grams of organic compound, 100 grams of
                superphosphate, and fifty grams of murate of hydroxide ought to be applied to every plant or pit.
                throughout flowering time apply 100 grams of urea pet plant or pit. significant irrigation should be
                provided at the time of pod development. </p>

            <h2>Irrigation</h2>
            <p> Drumstick plants will face up to drought conditions for up to 6 months. They need minimum irrigation for
                correct growth. Soil conditions cherish too dry or too wet can cause flower drop. Optimum soil wet ought
                to be maintained for additional yields. Irrigate fields once in an exceedingly week up to 3 months,
                followed by once in ten to twelve days thereafter. Irrigation might not be necessary throughout the
                rainy season. Maintain adequate soil moisture during the flowering amount and avoid stagnation of water.
            </p>

            <h2>Drumstick Harvest and Yielding</h2>
            <h3>Harvest</h3>
            <p>Drumstick Leaves and Shoots: cassia contains a compound leaf; various leaflets are connected to the
                rachis that stems from the branch. harvest home of leaves and shoots may be done manually by employing a
                combine of shears or sharp knife. Leaves and tender shoots should be harvested from one hundred to
                150-centimeter tree height forwards on top of the ground. In large-scale drumstick plantations,
                harvesting can be done mechanically. those that harvest shoots and leaves at the bottom of the leafstalk
                can be faster and easier, however will have less vigorous growth within the following harvest season.
            </p>
            <p><strong> Drumstick Seeds: </strong>
                it's counseled not to climb trees to reap fruits or seeds because the branches break simply. Pods that
                reach maturity are harvested immediately. Pods that flip chromatic and dry can open easily for
                extraction of seeds. Matured pods split open, rental seed fall on the ground. Matured seeds have
                sensible possibilities of germination and that they ought to be hold on in a very dry place. </p>
            <p> Drumstick Pods or Fruits:
                Tender pods may be harvested as shortly as they attain their pod length. every drumstick selection
                produces completely different pod lengths, reckoning on the tree variety pods should be harvested in
                step with their length. Pods that are tender, fleshy, and immature are harvested. Thick pods don't fetch
                worth within the market, thence they ought to be ignored for seed harvesting.
            </p>
            <h3>Yielding</h3>
            <p>Reckoning on the variability of the tree planted and farming practices, trees will provide 2 recent leaf
                harvests in a very year. thus also, depending on tree varieties, fresh pods may be harvested doubly in a
                year. underneath sensible cultivation, a drumstick plantation can yield eighteen to twenty tonnes of
                pods per acre each year and twenty five to thirty two tonnes of fresh leaves per acre in a year.</p>
