            <h1>How To Grow Cauliflower Crop</h1>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Cauliflower is one in every of famous vegetable and regarded as “Ghobi or Gobi” in India and this flower
                belongs to “Cruciferaceae” own circle of relatives regularly overshadowed with the aid of using its
                inexperienced cousin broccoli. This fit for human consumption part of the cauliflower is called ‘Curd’
                surrounded with the aid of using leaves narrower than the ones of cabbage. There are important seasonal
                forms of cauliflower is cultivated in India they're 1) Early season kind crop 2) Late season crop. Late
                cauliflower sorts are grown for an extended length as compared to Early crop kind. .</p>
                <img class="center" src="../img/cauliflower/cauliflower (5).jpeg" alt="Cauliflower" width="350px">
            <h2>Soil and climate conditions</h2>
            <h3>Climatic conditions – </h3>
            <p>Proper climatic situations are nearly required relying at the form of the cauliflower. Cauliflower grows
                nicely in a wet and funky climate. Cauliflower can maintain to low temperatures and for warm climatic
                situations much like cabbage. Extreme dry situations or low humidity aren't appropriate for Cauliflower
                cultivation.10°C to 25°C is highest quality temperature for suitable seed germination. High temperatures
                purpose bad great of curds. Lower temperatures can also additionally bring about delays in adulthood and
                undersized curd. </p>
            <h3>Soil conditions – </h3>
            <p> Cauliflower may be grown in extensive forms of soils furnished they're wealthy in natural be counted and
                holds enough and eventually own a very good water drainage. Sandy loamy soils are advocated for early
                plants and for overdue plants, clay loams and loam soils are preferred. This vegetable flourishes
                quality in soils whose P.H. variety is 6.zero to 7.zero.It is higher to head for soil checking out g
                earlier than cultivation. If the soil own PH cost beneath 5.5, liming @ 5-10 quintal/ha ought to be
                carried out for a success crop. Soils better in PH cost (> 7.zero) lower the supply of boron. </p>

            <h2>Sowing -</h2>
            <p>The seed ought to be sown in nursery beds in May to June for early crop cultivation, July to August for
                important crop cultivation and for overdue crop cultivation Sept-Oct. Before seedlings are organized in
                nursery beds, furrow kind of layout & ridges ought to be organized for this crop and the flora ought to
                be transplanted in important filed after three to four weeks. Spacing among flora ought to be forty five
                cm X forty five cm for early crop and 60 cm X 60 cm for overdue crop. </p>





            <h2>Fertilizer</h2>
            <p>Manures and Fertilizers in Cauliflower Cultivation:
                For quality end result 15- 20 lots of Farm Yard Manure (FYM) or any compost ought to be delivered the
                soil approximately Four weeks earlier than transplanting in instruction of soil. a hundred kg of N, 50
                kg of P2O5 /ha ought to be carried out in Cauliflower cultivation. </p>

            <h2>Irrigation</h2>
            <p> Watering ought to be furnished to crop each four – 7 days to the early planting and 10 to fifteen days
                for overdue crop cultivation. At head formation time, there ought to be sufficient moisture content
                material withinside the important field, so irrigation is needed at this factor in time. When
                cauliflower is cultivated overdue withinside the season, it ought to be irrigated frequently. Drip
                irrigation or Sprinkler irrigation also can be taken into consideration for using the water supply
                effectively.</p>

            <h2>Cauliflower Harvest and Yielding</h2>
            <h3>Harvest</h3>
            <p>Cauliflower might be equipped for harvesting whilst the right head has advanced. Make certain the
                pinnacle is compact and the plant have to be reduce beneath the pinnacle in order that the stub has left
                the pinnacle from negative for the duration of transportation. The cauliflower flora have to be whilst
                curds are nicely advanced. As all curds will now no longer come to the adulthood on the identical time,
                so simplest the ones that are complete advanced are removed. Harvesting for the duration of morning or
                nighttime is favored in order that the produce can be saved cool for the market. </p>
            <h3>Yielding</h3>
            <p> For early cauliflower crop, yield of 200-250 quintal /ha may be expected. For past due season crop,
                yield should approximately 250-three hundred quintal / ha.</p>
