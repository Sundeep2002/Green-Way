            <h1>How To Grow Mirchi Crop</h1>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Chilli is during all|one amongst|one in every of} the foremost valuable crops in Asian country. The crop
                is big mostly for its fruits everywhere India. it's utilized in India as a principal ingredient of
                assorted curries, and chutneys. it's additionally used for vegetables, spices, condiments, sauces, and

            <h2>Soil and climate conditions</h2>
            <h3>Climatic conditions – </h3>
            <p>The chili may be a plant of a tropical and subtropic region -It grows well in heat and wet climate and a
                temperature of 20-25°C. Low wet within the soil throughout blossom development and fruit formation
                causes the bud, deblossom and fruit drops. Excessive precipitation is damaging to the crops as a result
                of it brings concerning defoliation and putrefaction of the plant. As a rained crop, it's big in areas
                receiving annual precipitation of 25-30 inches. </p>
            <h3>Soil conditions – </h3>
            <p> Chili pepper is grown in a vary of soils, however black soils that retain wet for long periods are
                appropriate for rainfed crop whereas well-drained soils, deltaic soils, and sandy dirts are sensible
                below irrigated condition. However, in hills of Uttarakhand, chili pepper is big in a very big selection
                of soils starting from sandy to clay loam mixed with gravel and coarse sand. </p>

            <h2>Cultivation –</h2>
            <p>Chili pepper is grown all told variety of soft however the sandy – dirt, clay loam and loam soils are
                best fitted to it, the soil should be drained and well aerated. Acidic soils aren't appropriate for
                chili cultivation. </p>
                <img class="center" src="../img/mirchi/mirchi (2).jpeg" alt="Mirchi" width="350px">

            <h2>Sowing -</h2>
            <p>Direct sowing is practiced below rainfed conditions. For direct planted crop, the seeds are trained by
                the top of March or 1st week of April. Seed rate is 2.5-3.0 metric weight unit per acre. when thirty-40
                days of sowing, cutting and gap filling is finished on a cloudy day. </p>


            <h2>Fertilizer</h2>
            <p>Manures and Fertilizers in Mirchi Cultivation:
                In chili pepper Farming,10 to eleven tonnes/hectare of yard manure (FYM) or compost is applied at the
                time of field preparation. In chili pepper for rained crop fifty metric weight unit, N and twenty five
                kg P ought to be applied 1/2 dose of N full dose of P applied at the time of transplantation. Remaining
                Yi dose of N applied 30 days after transplanting for .irrigated crop a hundred kg N, 50kg P & 50 kg K
                should be applied per hectare. Fertilizers are applied in four equal doses. 1st applied at the time
                transplantation remaining doses are applied at fourth, 111 & 13′ week when transplanting. </p>

            <h2>Irrigation</h2>
            <p> Chili pepper cannot face up to significant moisture. thence irrigation ought to incline only if
                necessary. Frequent and heavy irrigation induces lanky vegetative growth and causes flower shedding.
                Plant growth, branching, and dry matter accumulation are adversely full of excess irrigation. the
                quantity of irrigation and interval between irrigation depends on soil and climatical conditions. If the
                plants show drooping of leaves at 4 p.m., it's a sign that irrigation is needed. Flowering and fruit
                development in chili pepper are the foremost important stages of water requirement. unremarkably chili
                pepper is big below rain-fed condition.</p>

            <h2>Mirchi Harvest and Yielding</h2>
            <h3>Harvest</h3>
            <p>Chilli is very putrefiable in nature. It needs additional attention throughout harvest, storage, and
                transportation. harvest home ought to be done at the correct stage of maturity. chillyes that are used
                for vegetable functions are usually harvested whereas they're still inexperienced however full grown.
                chillyes are harvested at the red color stage for work purpose. Chillies used for drying are harvested
                at full ripe-stage which may be was Chilli powder. </p>
            <h3>Yielding</h3>
            <p>The yield varies in line with the system of cultivation. The yield of dry Chillies of the rainfed crop is
                two hundred – four hundred kilogram and that of the irrigated crop is 600 – a thousand kilogram per
                acre. The proportion of dry to contemporary japed Chillies varies from 25% to 40%.</p>
