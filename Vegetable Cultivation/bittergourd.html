            <h1>How To Grow Bitter Gourd Crop</h1>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Bitter Gourd also knows as Bitter melon on other parts of the world. Bitter gourd is one of the most
                popular vegetables in India. It is grown extensively throughout India; the bitter gourd has good
                medicinal value as well.</p>
                <img class="center" src="../img/bittergourd/bittergourd (4).jpeg" alt="Bittergourd" width="350px">
            <h2>Soil and climate conditions</h2>
            <p>The best medium for the seeds is a fertile, well-drained soil with a pH ranging from 5.5 to 6.7, enriched
                with organic matter, such as compost or dried manure. But it will tolerate any soil that provides a good
                drainage system (sandy loam soil, but it will grow in areas with poorer soils.) It should be in a
                frost-free area and will prefer the climate with daytime temperatures between 24°C and 35°C. The soil
                must be prepared well by adding organic matter before planting. Seeds soaked in water will germinate
                sooner. Soil temperature for germination is at least 20°C to 25°C. Mainly a warm season plant, bitter
                gourd thrives in hot and humid climates.</p>

            <h2>Cultivation –</h2>
            <p>Plough the field to fine tilth and dig pits of 30 cm x 30 cm x 30 cm size at 2 x 1.5 m spacing and form
                basins.</p>
                <img class="center" src="../img/bittergourd/bittergourd (5).jpeg" alt="Bittergourd" width="350px">
            <h2>Sowing -</h2>
            <p>The seed is sown by dibbling method at a spacing of 120×90 cm. Generally, three to four seeds are sown in
                a pit at 2.5 to 3.0 cm depth. The seeds are soaked in water overnight before sowing for better
                germination. Seed germination was enhanced by soaking the seeds for 24 hours in a solution of 25 to 50
                ppm GA and 25 ppm boron. In flatbed, layout seeds are dibbled at the spacing 1-meter x 1 meter.</p>



            <h2>Fertilizer</h2>
            <p>Manures and Fertilizers in Bitter Gourd Cultivation:
                Apply 10 kg of FYM per pit (20 t/ha) 100 grams of NPK 6:12:12/pit as basal and 10 grams of N/pit 30 days
                after sowing. Apply Azospirillum and Phosphobacteria 2 kg/ha and Pseudomonas @ 2.5 kg/ha along with FYM
                50 kg and neem cake @ 100 kg before the last plowing.</p>

            <h2>Irrigation</h2>
            <p> Irrigate the basins before dibbling the seeds and thereafter once a week. Install a drip system with
                main and sub-main pipes and place the inline lateral tubes at an interval of 1.5m. Place the drippers in
                lateral tubes at an interval of 60 cm and 50 cm spacing with 4LPH and 3.5 LPH capacities respectively.
            </p>

                            reduction in leaf size and elongation and/or suppression of one or two lobes. Young

                            their size. Some of the leaves show marked reduction in the development of lamina resulting
                            in a shoestring effect. The virus is transmitted by five species of aphids

                            Aphids produce honeydew, a sticky exudate that serves as
                            substrate for the growth
                            of sooty mold. It also interferes with the leaves’ photosynthesis and transpiration.

                            ZYMV,ChiVMV), Luteovirus (CAYV/NMK) and Cucumovirus (CMV).

                            Regulate use of nitrogen fertilizer, excessive nitrogen fertilization favors aphid

            <h2>Bitter Gourd Harvest and Yielding</h2>
            <p>Harvesting is done when the fruits are still young and tender at every alternate day. Picking should be
                done carefully so that the vine may not be damaged. The fruits should not be allowed to mature on the
                vines. The harvested fruits may be stored for 3 to 4 days of in-cool condition. The yield is 60 to 100
                quintal/ha.</p>
