            <h1>How To Grow Lady Finger Crop</h1>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Lady Finger Okra is one amongst the vital vegetable crops of India. it's full-grown throughout the
                tropical and sub-tropical regions and conjointly within the hotter components of the temperate regions.
                Okra or Lady Finger plant belongs to the family Malvaceae. The biological process worth of 100g of
                edible okra is characterised 1.9 g protein, 0.2 g fat, 6.4 g carbohydrate, 0.7 g minerals and 1.2 g
                fibers. Okra or woman Finger includes a sensible potential as an overseas money dealer</p>
                <img class="center" src="../img/ladyfinger/ladyfinger (2).jpeg" alt="Ladyfinger" width="350px">
            <h2>Soil and climate conditions</h2>
            <h3>Climatic conditions – </h3>
            <p>Lady Finger needs long heat season throughout its growing period. It offers sensible yield in heat wet
                condition. It grows best among a temperature vary of 22-35°C. It is with success full-grown in season
                even in serious precipitation area. Bhendi is very liable to frost injury. Seeds fail to germinate once
                temperature is below 20 °C. </p>
            <h3>Soil conditions – </h3>
            <p> Lady Finger can be grown well altogether types of soil. .But sandy soil and clay-loam soils are best for
                its cultivation. The optimum hydrogen ion concentration range is between six and 6.8. Soils with high
                organic matter are most well-liked so cartloads of FYM (Farm Yard Manure) or compost ought to be
                incorporated throughout land preparation. Soil should have sensible internal drainage. </p>

            <h2>Cultivation</h2>
            <p>The land should be ready with 2-3 ploughing. Well rotten FYM (25 t/ha) is incorporated at the time of
                land preparation. Bhendi is seeded on ridges or on flat soil. If soil is heavy, sowing should be done on
                ridges. Application of organic manure like organic fertilizer and poultry manures improves the plant
                growth and also the yield during this crop. it's attainable to scale back the employment fertilizer by
                victimization neem cake and poultry manures or the other compost.</p>
                <img class="center" src="../img/ladyfinger/ladyfinger (3).jpeg" alt="Ladyfinger" width="350px">
            <h2>Sowing</h2>
            <p>Seed rate of Lady Finger is concerning 3.5-5.5 metric weight unit seeds/ha throughout summer seasons and
                8-10 kg seeds/ha for season crop. The seed rate usually varies with germination percentage, spacing and
                season. Before sowing the seeds are soaked in an exceedingly resolution of Bavistin (0.2%) for six
                hours. The seeds are then dried in shade. The seeds are dibbled on the either facet of the furrows at a
                spacing of sixty x thirty cm in kharif season and 30 x 30 cm in summer season. </p>




            <h2>Fertilizer</h2>
            <p>The fertiliser dose depends upon the fertility of the soil and also the quantity of organic manure
                applied to the Okra crop. concerning twenty to twenty five tones/ha of FYM(farmyard manure) is mixed at
                the time of land preparation. Normally, the applying of a hundred metric weight unit N, 60kg P, and
                fifty kg K is suggested for optimum yield. Fertilizers is applied by gap up a deep slim furrow on one
                facet of every sowing ridge. Generally, atomic number 7 fertilizers like urea, metallic element nitrate
                (CAN), and ammonium ion sulphate should be used for this crop. </p>

            <h2>Irrigation</h2>
            <p> Drip irrigation is most fitted wet within the soil throughout summer months for quicker growth. Drip
                irrigation is most fitted to the girl Fingercrop because it provides uniform wet throughout the season.
                The daily water demand of Lady Fingercrop is 2.4 l/day/4 plants throughout early growth stage and 7.6
                l/day/4 plants during the height growth stage. The irrigation system ought to be operated daily for
                seventy five minutes during initial growth stage and for 228 minutes during peak growth of the crop with
                an electrode capability of two lph. installation on daily or on alternate days with On-line form of
                drippers is preferred.</p>

            <h2>Lady Finger Harvest and Yielding</h2>
            <h3>Harvest</h3>
            <p>Relying upon the range and season, the gathering amount varies between forty five and sixty five days
                when seed sowing. the dimensions of the pods and also the stage at that they're harvested vary with the
                plant variety or hybrid and market preference. </p>
            <p>The Okra fruits are handpicked; hand gloves or fabric luggage are wont to defend fingers. The fruits is
                harvested on all alternate days and early harvesting leads to low yields of tender fruits with a brief
                shelf life. Flowering and mature intensity cut back in Okra plants which don't seem to be often picked
                for tender pods. </p>
            <h3>Yielding</h3>
            <p>Crop yield varies greatly relying upon the range and season of cultivation. On average, Okra yields 7.5
                to ten tonnes/ square measure and also the yield of hybrid varieties ranges from 15–22 tonnes/hectare.
