            <h1>How To Grow Cabbage Crop</h1>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The cabbage may be a well-liked vascular plant of the species Brassica Family ANd is employed as a
                ivy-covered inexperienced vegetable. the sole a part of the plant that's ordinarily eaten up is that the
                leafy head; additional precisely, the spherical cluster of immature leaves, excluding the part unpleated
                outer leaves. Cabbage is used in a very style of dishes for its naturally spicy flavor. The supposed
                “cabbage head” is wide consumed raw, cooked, or preserved in a nice variety of dishes. Cabbage is a
                wonderful supply of alimentation C. It conjointly contains important amounts of glutamine, an
                aminoalkanoic acid that has anti-inflammatory drug properties.</p>
                <img class="center" src="../img/cabbage/cabbage (1).jpeg" alt="Cabbage" width="350px">
            <h2>Soil and climate conditions</h2>
            <h3>Climatic conditions – </h3>
            <p>Cabbage grows best in a very cool damp climate and is extremely hardy to frost. in a veryreas with
                relatively dry atmospheres, its leaves tend to be additional clearly stalk than within the more wet
                areas. In a hot dry atmosphere, its quality becomes poor and far of its delicate flavor is lost. Its
                germination is best at a soil temperature of regarding 55°F to 60°F. Temperatures below this and on top
                of this aren't fitted to it. Well, hardened seedlings will tolerate a temperature of 20°F to 25°F. it's
                adult chiefly as rabi crop throughout winter. </p>
            <h3>Soil conditions – </h3>
            <p> Cabbage is full-grown in varied kinds of soils starting from sandy dirt to clay. It needs a pH scale
                ranging from 5.5 to 6.5 for higher production. It additionally thrives best once the soil is made in
                organic matter and sensible drain.</p>

            <h2>Cultivation –</h2>
            <p>Cabbage cultivation is finished on sandy to serious soils wealthy in organic matter. On heavy soils,
                plants grow slowly and also the keeping quality is improved. A pH vary of 6.0 to 6.5 is taken into
                account optimum for growing cabbage. Cabbage is usually cultivated during a cool damp climate and it's
                big as a winter crop in plains.</p>
                <img class="center" src="../img/cabbage/cabbage (2).jpeg" alt="Cabbage" width="350px">
            <h2>Sowing</h2>
            <p>The seeds are seeded during a bed and 4- to 6-week-old seedlings are transplantation to the field. Raised
                beds of size three x 0.6 m and ten to fifteen cm tall are prepared. In India, it's fully grown in
                massive areas having a cool and damp climate.</p>


            <h2>Fertilizer</h2>
            <p>It is higher to use organic compound rather than ammonium ion sulfate wherever the soil is comparatively
                acidic. If the soil is element deficient, 5 –10 weight unit/ha mineral ought to be applied before land
                preparation. For basal fertilizer, manure should be applied into the rows before chemical fertilizer.
                Chemical fertilisers: Fertilizer application varies with soil fertility.Basal application before
                transplanting: twenty five:50:60 NPK kg / acre. 1st dressing 10-15 days once transplanting: 25:50:60 NPK
                kg / acre. Second application twenty – 25 days after first high dressing: 25:00:00 NPK kg / acre.Third
                application 10-15 days after second application: 25:00:00 NPK kg / acre. element & atomic number 42
                ought to be sprayed at the button stage.</p>

            <h2>Cabbage Harvest and Yielding</h2>
            <h3>Harvest</h3>
            <p>Cabbage is normally harvested when the heads reach full size and are firm, In cabbage harvesting is done
                depending on the maturity of the head and demand in the market. Normally harvesting is done when heads
                are firm. If prices are high in the market harvesting is done earlier when heads are small and loose
                heads are cut with a knife with little stalk arid some leaves. Proper grading is followed before heads
                are sent to market.</p>
            <h3>Yielding</h3>
            <p>Usually Hills: 70 – eighty t/ha in a hundred and fifty days. Plains: 25 – 35 t/ha in one hundred twenty
                days. The yield of cabbage relies upon upon the variety, developing season and control practices.</p>
